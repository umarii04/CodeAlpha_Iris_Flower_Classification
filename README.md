# Iris Flower Classification - CodeAlpha

This project is a Jupyter Notebook implementation for classifying Iris flowers using machine learning techniques. The notebook is named `CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification.ipynb` and is part of the Code Alpha task series.

## Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to predict the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on its features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, which is widely used for pattern recognition and machine learning.

## Features
- Data loading and exploration
- Data visualization
- Data preprocessing
- Model training (using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Model evaluation and accuracy reporting
- Prediction on new data

## How to Run
1. Open the `CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and view the outputs.
3. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed (see below).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is loaded directly from scikit-learn's datasets module, so no manual download is required.

## Results
The notebook demonstrates the process of training and evaluating different machine learning models for Iris flower classification, with accuracy metrics and visualizations.
